            <p className="aboutDesc">I am Ugur Emir Azi. I was born on June 3, 2003, in Istanbul. <br /><br />  For a while, I tried to figure out what I wanted from life, and here I am now. <br /> <br />  I started my software journey as a Computer Engineering student at BartÄ±n University.<br /> <br />  During this process, I have learned a lot. I spent some time developing myself in Java, which was very beneficial to me. <br /> <br />  After that, I moved on to Python. Later, I found myself working with React, and Iâ€™m really enjoying it. <br /> <br />  Thanks to my university, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to experience many fields, including C#, PHP, MySQL, Assembly, and more. <br /><br />  Currently, I am preparing myself to become a full-stack developer.<br /><br />  As for my hobbies, I enjoy cycling, swimming, photography, styling, and simply reading books and listening to music.<br /> <br /> I consider myself a fun and easygoing person. I am always open to new ideas and ready to learn new things. I am excited to see what the future holds for me. ðŸš€</p>
